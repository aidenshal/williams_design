# About This Site

This Eleventy site is a **web front-end** for the existing Williams Design
System documentation.

- Content source:
  [Williams Design System repository](https://github.com/aidenshal/williams_design)
- Build system: [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) with a11y-friendly,
  fast-loading pages.
- Quality gates: ESLint, Stylelint, Prettier, Markdownlint, JSCPD
  duplication checks, link checking, and Lighthouse CI.

The goal is to keep the original Markdown docs as a “textbook” while also
providing a **navigable, production-style website** that could be deployed
to GitHub Pages.
