# Williams Design System

This site turns the **Williams Design System** docs into a browsable website
for the Outlaw Coffee brand.

It pulls ideas from four core documents in the repository:

- **Brand Archetype** – defines Outlaw Coffee’s core personality and visual
  style.
- **Cialdini Methods of Persuasion** – maps psychological triggers to how
  the brand communicates.
- **Competitive Landscape** – analyzes how Outlaw Coffee should stand out
  from existing coffee brands.
- **Sales Funnel / Customer Journey** – shows how visitors move from
  awareness to loyal fans.

Explore each section:

- [Brand Archetype]({{ '/archetype/' | url }})
- [Cialdini Methods]({{ '/cialdini/' | url }})
- [Competitive Landscape]({{ '/competitive-landscape/' | url }})
- [Sales Funnel]({{ '/sales-funnel/' | url }})
- [About this site]({{ '/about/' | url }})

For the original design system docs, see the
[Williams Design System README](https://github.com/aidenshal/williams_design/blob/main/README.md).
