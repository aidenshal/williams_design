## What is a Sales Funnel?

A sales funnel is the journey customers take from first discovering a brand to becoming loyal buyers. It’s called a funnel because many people enter at the top (awareness), but only a smaller portion make it all the way to the bottom (action).

Each stage — Awareness, Interest, Desire, and Action (AIDA) — guides potential customers closer to a purchase through messaging, design, and emotional triggers. For a bold brand like Outlaw Coffee, the funnel is about creating rebellion in every sip, turning casual coffee drinkers into loyal fans who reject “corporate coffee culture.”


### The AIDA Model
The most common framework for understanding sales funnels is **AIDA**:
- **A**wareness: Getting the customer's attention
- **I**nterest: Building curiosity about your product/service  
- **D**esire: Creating emotional connection and want
- **A**ction: Encouraging the final conversion (purchase, signup, etc.)

## Stage 1: Awareness

> *"How do we attract people who don't know about us yet?"*

### What Happens in This Stage

In the awareness stage, potential customers first encounter the Outlaw Coffee brand. They’re looking for something different — tired of mainstream, soulless coffee brands. Our goal is to grab attention instantly with visuals and language that scream rebellion, authenticity, and power.

### Common Website Techniques

**Visual Elements:**
